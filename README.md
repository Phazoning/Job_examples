Q: Why does this repository exist?
A: Because I have the need to have a place where I can drop sample file when appliying for jobs

Q: What's going to be uploaded here?
A: Nothing specific, but the main idea is to upload files in order to show my programming abilities

Q: How's each file organized?
A: It's easy, each function is going to have a comment (in English) with the meaning of each parameter, how the function works
   and the values/s it returns if there is any. The only exception to this are functions within functions, whose comment is added
   to the main function one, setting it as a sub-function
   
Q: I found an error on a script, should I report it?
A: Yes, please, do not hesitate to contact me in case you have found a fault on a script
